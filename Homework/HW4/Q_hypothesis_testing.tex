[20 Points] Hypothesis Testing

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 

Consider a set of data points \( Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_m \), where each point is independently drawn from a normal distribution with mean \( \theta \) and a variance of \( \tau^2 \). The value of \( \theta \) is not known to us, whereas \( \tau^2 \) is a given constant. Construct a statistical test with a significance threshold of \( \beta \) to determine if there's substantial evidence to differentiate between the following two scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item The true mean \( \theta \) is equal to a specific hypothesized value \( \theta_0 \).
\item The true mean \( \theta \) is different from \( \theta_0 \).
\end{itemize}

    \item

In a specific country, the typical stature for adult men is known to be 170 centimeters. There's a hypothesis that environmental influences could lead to a variation in this average within a particular urban area. To investigate, a group of 9 adult men was randomly selected from this urban population, yielding these measurements for their heights in centimeters:

\[
176.2, \quad 157.9, \quad 160.1, \quad 180.9, \quad 165.1, \quad 167.2, \quad 162.9, \quad 155.7, \quad 166.2
\]

It is presumed that the heights are distributed according to a normal distribution. The task is to evaluate the following propositions:

\[
H_0: \lambda = 170,
\]

\[
H_1: \lambda \neq 170.
\]

Given the sampled data, the goal is to ascertain if there is sufficient statistical justification to dismiss \( H_0 \) when the level of significance is set at \( \beta = 0.05 \). [\(\lambda\) here is the mean]
