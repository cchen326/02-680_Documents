When the set used to define a tuple is the set of real $\reals$ (or complex $\mathbb{C}$%
\footnote{It will generally be true throughout the class that the properties we're discussing also apply to complex numbers, but for simplicity we will usually only directly discuss reals.})
numbers, we call the tuple a \emph{vector}.
Specifically an $n$-vector $x$ is defined as an element in \[x\in \reals^n.\] 
If we want to reference the $i$-th element of $x$ we will write \[x_i\] (or sometimes $x[i]$, this is true of tuples as well).

\section{Simple Operations}
Graphically we can think of vectors (in $\reals^2$) in two way, which are... somewhat equivalent: 
as a point on the plane, or as an arrow from the origin.
The second will be useful in this section, but the latter is sometimes useful as well. 


\subsection{Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication}
Both of these operations are element-wise. 
For vectors $x,y \in \reals^n$
\[
z = x+y \;\;\rightarrow \;\; z_i = x_i + y_i \;\;\; \forall 1 \le i \le n.
\]
Thus $z \in \reals^n$ as well. 

In the context of this course, especially when talking about vectors, a \emph{scalar} is a single number (i.e. $a \in \reals$) rather than a vector. 
(The implication is that $\reals$ and $\reals^1$ are not the same thing.)
When multiplying a vector $x\in \reals^n$ by a scalar $a\in\reals$, we once again apply this element-wise. 
Thus the result, $z\in\reals^n$ can be computed as:
\[
z = ax \;\; \rightarrow \;\; z_i = a x_i \;\;\; \forall 1 \le i \le n.
\]

\subsection{Norms}
Informally these are measures of the size of a vector, and all come in the form of a function $f: \reals^n \mapsto \reals$, and has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall x \in \reals*n : f(x)\ge 0$
\item $\forall x \in \reals*n, c\in\reals : f(cx) = |c|f(x)$ 
\item $\forall x,y \in \reals*n : f(x+y)\le f(x) + f(y)$
\item $f(x) = 0 \iff x=0$
\end{itemize}

The 3rd property comes up a lot, its called the \emph{triangle inequality}

In general the form of the $\ell_p$ norm is:
\[
\|x\|_p = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \left|x_i\right|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}.
\]

\paragraph{Vector length.} Often times called the $L_2$- or Euclidian-norm of a vector. 
If we think of the vector as an arrow, we can say the \emph{length} of the vector (arrow) is the same as the hypotenuse 
right triangle with each leg having the same length as each one of the elements. 
In that case we know that for vector $x = \left\langle x_1,x_2\right\rangle\in\reals^2$, the length is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$.
To generalize this we say the length of a vector $x\in\reals^n$
\[
\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i\right)^2}.
\]

\paragraph{Other common norms.}
The $\ell_1$-norm:
\[
\|x\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \left|x_i\right|.
\]

The $\ell_\infty$-norm: 
\[
\|x\|_\infty = \max_{x_i \in x} \big(x_i\big)
\]


\section{Dot Product}
While a scalar times a vector is a vector, it turns out a vector times a vector is a scalar! 
Lets define it first then we will dive in;
for $x,y \in \reals^n$
\[
x \bullet y = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot y_i.
\]
(note sometimes we will use $\bullet$ vs $\cdot$ to differentiate scalar multiplication and dot product, but generally only the latter is used since the domains of the functions are different and can be extracted from context.)

We often think of dot product as telling us how vectors go ``in the same direction''. 
Consider two cardinal vectors (going directly along an axis) on the plane;
intuitively they go in totally different directions (note, this is different from \textit{opposite} directions). 
WLG one vector must be $\langle a, 0 \rangle$ and the other must be  $\langle 0,b \rangle$ (for scalars $a,b\in\reals$). 
Using the definition above $\langle a, 0 \rangle \bullet \langle 0,b \rangle = 0$.
Consider a third vector $\langle c, 0 \rangle$ with $c\in\reals$, but enforce that $a \ge 0$ and $c \le 0$. 
In this case the result is $\langle a, 0 \rangle \bullet \langle c,0 \rangle = ac$, which we know is negative; 
they share a lot of direction, but go opposite ways! 

We can actually redefine the $L_2$-norm of a vector $x\in\reals^n$ using the dot product:
\[
\|x\| = \sqrt{x \cdot x}.
\]
