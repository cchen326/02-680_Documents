\emph{What is a ``Statistic''?}
\begin{center}
Definition: Anything that can be computed from the collected data\\ (i.e., must be observable).
\end{center}

Statistics deals with data.

Goal: Make inferences based on data

This process can be divided into three overlapping phases
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Collecting data} --- collect data in experiments; Preceded by forming hypotheses about phenomena of interest 
\item \textbf{Describing data} --- describe the results
\item \textbf{Analyzing data} --- infer from the results the strength of the evidence with respect to the hypotheses
\end{enumerate}

Generally two types of statistics
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{Point statistic} --- a single value computed from data (e.g., $\overline{X_n}$)
\item[] \textbf{Interval or range statistics} ---  an interval $a\le x \le b$ computed from the data
\end{itemize} 

Note that a statistic is itself a random variable 
because a new experiment will produce new data to compute it.
